## 📌 About the Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset to answer questions like:

- What type of content is most available on Netflix?
- Which countries produce the most content?
- What trends are visible over time?
- What are the most frequent genres?

The goal is to practice data analysis and visualization skills while learning how to work with real-world data.
